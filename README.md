## I | Description: 

“Howl Are You, Mr. Rabbit?” is a two-player online game displayed on a website inspired by the Pacman and the traditional game of tag. The user enters the website to see a portal where they can create a new room to start a match with another player and enter a username of their choice or join a room created by someone else by clicking on a leaf. The user enters the room to see the instructions for the game and start playing. They have the option to be either a wolf, who needs to hunt the rabbit before it eats all the food in the forest, or be the rabbit that needs to escape from the wolf. 

## II | Final idea inspiration:

Our final website consisted of two parts:
- An entry page with animations and a new user interface to join and create rooms.
- The rooms displaying the videogame to start a new match,
The innovative factor of our idea focuses on the user interface. From the landing page, our website allows fun interactions that differentiate it from average input pages for videogames. We’re sure that this concept offers an interesting experience beyond playing a Pacman-inspired videogame.


### A - Expansion Ideas: 

More games for the user to play: the user could choose a game to play after they create a room. Ideas of games that would be interesting for the user could be Skribble, Snake, Tetris, etc.
To polish the user interface: make our website more intuitive, such as to show game name with each leaf if we implement the previous point.
To give homogeneity to our design: we would work on a design that is similar on each page that resembles old indie games with modern aesthetics.


### B - Technical ideas:
To implement namespaces to expand our Socket.io skills.
To ameliorate our current socket connections. 
To add more details on the game screen about different users, so it gives a more personalized experience.
To make the game more intuitive with the design, so the instructions for the game are not necessary in the beginning of each match.
To fix the bugs in each other’s part of the project (we will detail this point in our personal documentation).

## The Unified Final Result
> (aka. masterpiece even if it does not work as we had hoped.)
In the beginning, I was working on my own but I started collaborating with Fatema Nassar when we realized that our creative concepts could go along very well. Her animations of leaves falling down gave the forest theme of this game and gave birth to “HAYMR?”.
